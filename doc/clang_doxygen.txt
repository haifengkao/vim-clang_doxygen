1. Introduction					*clang_doxygen-introduction*

The clang doxygen plugin creates Doxygen comments for C/C++ code.

Why another Doxygen plugin?~

While I was looking for a vim plugin to help me document my C++ source code I
looked at the several plugins that are available.  All had some restrictions
or shortcomings, so that I was not really happy with the available plugins.
Also none of the plugins seemed to be actively maintained, so there was little
hope for improvement.
At the same time I was testing the XPTemplate plugin for inserting code
snippets.  Then a crazy idea was born.  What if it was possibly to create a
/dynamic/ snippet to comfortably enter the documentation into the Doxygen
comment?  After a few hacks and proof-of-concept implementation this plugin
was born.

Why does this plugin depend on libClang?~

As correctly parsing C++ is very hard, one of the reasons why the other
Doxygen plugins fail in some cases, the work is left to the professionals of
the Clang development team, see |clang_doxygen-prequesites|.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements					*clang_doxygen-requirements*

The C interface to the Clang compiler (libClang) is used to parse the source
code and extract information like parameter names and return type.  For this
plugin libClang version 3.0 or greater must be installed on the system.

==============================================================================
3. Usage					*clang_doxygen-usage*

							*GenerateDoxygen*
:GenerateDoxygen	Generate Doxygen comment for the declaration at the
			current cursor position.  If the cursor is placed in
			leading whitespace a declaration a declaration will be
			searched to the right on the same line.

==============================================================================
4. Caveats					*clang_doxygen-caveats*

The libClang Python bindings of the Clang project are included in this plugins
distribution.  The included Python module should be preferred over versions
present on the users' system.  However there might be other plugins that also
include the Python bindings in their distribution.  The version of the module
that is loaded by Vim then depends on the order in which the plugins are
loaded. As long as the loaded version of the module includes all the
functionality needed by clang Doxygen you should be fine.  However, if other
plugins depend on a newer version of the Python module this might cause a
problem.
The only plugin known by the author that includes the libClang Python bindings
is clang complete (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302) by
Xavier Deguillard.  Version 1.8 of clang complete plays along nicely with
clang doxygen.

The author would also like to thank drdr xp, the author of the XPTemplate
plugin, the Clang development team and Bram for making this awesome editor!
